The test programs in the dgemm directory do a simple matrix multiply test for
TiledArray (dense, sparse, and banded) matrices, Eigen, and BLAS. The TiledArray
tests are distributed memory applications and should be run with MPI. The 
applications require the following inputs:

blas matrix_size [repetitions]
