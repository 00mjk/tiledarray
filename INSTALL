# Install Dependencies

## Installing Xcode
### OS X 10.7 (Lion) and later
1. Open Mac App Store
2. Search for and “Buy” Xcode (it is free). Xcode will automatically start
   downloading and install itself.
3. Open Xcode
4. Go to Xcode->Preferences...
5. Select the Downloads and then the components tab
6. Click “Install” next to “Command Line Tools”
7. Check the “Check for and install updates automatically” box

**Note:** Command-line tools are automatically installed with Xcode 4.2.x and 
          earlier.

### Xcode Alternative for OS X 10.7 (Lion) and later
If you do not want to install Xcode, you may install just Apple's Command-Line
Tools package (the same package you would install with Xcode). You can download
it from the [Apple Developer website](http://developer.apple.com). The only
disadvantage to this method is you must update this software manually.

### Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) and earlier
1. Download Xcode 3.2.6 for Snow Leopard or 3.1.4 for Leopard from
   [Apple’s Developer website](http://developer.apple.com). You will need to log
   in with your Apple ID.
2. Open the .dmg file
3. Double click install package
4. Follow the prompts

## MacPorts
MacPorts is a command-line tool that automates the process of downloading, 
configuring, installing, and updating open-source software in OS X. Most of the
software required by TiledArray is available through MacPorts. To install
MacPorts:
1. Download the install package from: http://www.macports.org/
2. Open the downloaded .dmg file.
3. Double click the install package
4. Follow the prompts
5. Once MacPorts is installed, in Terminal run:

    $ sudo port selfupdate

**Note:** If you are behind a firewall or proxy and having trouble syncing
          portfiles, you can use the alternate download method described
          [here](https://trac.macports.org/wiki/howto/PortTreeTarball).

You can install the remaining software need by TiledArray with MacPorts.

    $ sudo port install autoconf automake libtool cmake eigen3 +cmake boost subversion git-core doxygen

## Installing MPI
You may choose either MPICH or OpenMPI. You do **NOT** need to install both. To
install MPI on your computer you may:
* Use a software management program such as [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org) 
  or [HomeBrew](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/).
* Build and install MPI manually. See the respective documentation for details.
  * [MPICH documentation](http://www.mpich.org/documentation/guides/)
  * [OpenMPI documentation](http://www.open-mpi.org/doc/)

### Installing MPICH with MacPorts
* OS X 10.7 (Lion) or later:

    `$ sudo port install mpich +clang`

* Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) or earlier:

    `$ sudo port install mpich`

### Install OpenMPI with MacPorts
    $ sudo port install openmpi +threads-gcc47

## MADNESS
You have two options for installing MADNESS:

1. Build and install MADNESS as a nested project. This is the default behavior 
   if MADNESS is not found by the configure script. **RECOMMENDED**
2. Build and install MADNESS manually as described
   [here](https://code.google.com/p/m-a-d-n-e-s-s/wiki/BuildingMadnessonOSX).

# Build TiledArray

## Download
In Terminal:

    $ mkdir tiledarray
    $ cd tiledarray
    $ git clone https://github.com/ValeevGroup/TiledArray.git src

## Configure

The configure commands below assume that Eigen 3 and Boost were installed in 
/opt/local with MacPorts.

### Lion (OS X 10.7) and later
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ ../../src/tiledarray/configure \
        --prefix=/path/to/tiledarray/install \
        --debug \
        --boost=/opt/local \
        --search="/opt/local" \
        --mpicc=/opt/local/bin/mpicc
        CC=/usr/bin/clang \
        CXX=/usr/bin/clang++ \
        CPPFLAGS="-Wvexing-parse" 

### Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6) and earlier

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ ../../src/tiledarray/configure \
        --prefix=/path/to/tiledarray/install \
        --debug \
        --boost=/opt/local \
        --search="/opt/local" \
        --mpicc=/opt/local/bin/mpicc
        CC=/usr/bin/gcc \
        CXX=/usr/bin/g++

### Build and Install
    $ make -j
    ... many lines omitted ...
    $ make install

# Information about Compiler
The following compiles have been tested with TiledArray on OS X and are known to
work.
* Apple's Clang 2.0 (svn 2.9) and later **(Preferred)**
* LLVM Clang 2.9 and later (same as Apple's version)
* Intel 11.x and 12.x
* Apple's GCC 4.2.1 (deprecated by Apple)
* Apple's LLVM GCC 4.2.1 (deprecated by Apple)

**Note:** Do not use GNU GCC compilers that you build yourself or those provided
          by MacPorts. They have significant compatibility issues on Macs and
          may result in strange runtime behavior.
